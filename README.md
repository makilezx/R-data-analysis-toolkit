# R data analysis toolkit

These snippets showcase a series of research studies conducted on various datasets with the aim to explore and understand different psychology constructs and phenomena. The analyses performed on these datasets include correlation analysis to examine relationships between variables, t-tests to compare means between different groups, hierarchical regressions to explore the predictive relationships among variables, and ANCOVA to assess group differences while accounting for covariates. All of these analyses were implemented using the R programming language
## Dataset

The analyses in this portfolio are conducted on psychology research datasets. These datasets have undergone data cleaning, transformation, and preparation before the analyses were performed. Each code snippet 

## Code Snippets

The repository includes the following code snippets:

1. `t_test_comparison_correlations.R`: This snippet includes the calculation and interpretation of correlations between variables. Also it showcases the implementation of t-tests to compare means between different groups in the dataset.

2. `hierarchical_regression.R`: This snippet illustrates the application of hierarchical regression analysis to explore the relationship between predictor variables and an outcome variable.

3. `ancova_analysis.R`: This snippet demonstrates the use of ANCOVA (Analysis of Covariance) to assess the differences between groups while controlling for covariates.

4. `cfa_analysis.R`: This snippet demonstrates the implementation of Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) to assess the fit of a specified theoretical factor structure to the observed data in the research dataset. It involves testing the goodness-of-fit indices, examining factor loadings, and evaluating model fit indices such as chi-square, comparative fit index (CFI), root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), and standardized root mean square residual (SRMR).
